I would like to learn enough software and machine learning skills in order to perform data science in healthcare, the field I came from. I would like to have enough data science and analytic skills to start in a field that is non-Healthcare related if an option as well. This class is a restart for my career. I am a recovering Healthcare CEO of over 13 years who was heavily involved in physician partnerships, development, and reformations for Surgical Hospitals and Ambulatory Surgery Centers. I found that this was not the path I wanted to continue on. I started taking on more assignments without really learning more. I want to be able to manipulate data in order to solve real life problems and make predictive analysis using machine learning models.

The skills in this class will help me in my future career because instead of receiving visualizations or bottom-line reports and having to dig, or call someone to assist in explaining parts of the reports prior to decision and strategy formation, I will be able to more effectively and efficiently interpret the data and adapt it to my needs/or a teamâ€™s needs. I am really interested in moving into a corporate role requiring analysis (data, economical, statistical, market, competitive, etc.) and strategic development through the use of data analytics. After managing very large medical staffs of 400-600 professionals and teams of 64-93 people across departments, I am highly interested in managing or being part of a much smaller and focused team. 
I also need to be able to work remotely and travel as I am married to a Surgical First Assist seeking travel positions. By learning data science and analytical skills, I am seeking remote employment opportunities that I can merge my past experience with in order to be a productive contributor to a new company/team.
